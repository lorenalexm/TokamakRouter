# TokamakRouter

> Simple location hash-based navigation for Tokamak web apps.

TokamakRouter is based on the amazing work of [frzi/SwiftUIRouter](https://github.com/frzi/SwiftUIRouter/), which brings path-based routing to SwiftUI. This repository hopes to bring a similar solution to [Tokamak](https://tokamak.dev).
